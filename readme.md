Actually Journalism
====

This website exists to mock the most egregiously asinine prose produced in the service of "explainer" journalism or, as it has been more aptly described, ["actually" journalism](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/3/nate-silver-new-mediajournalismwebstartups.html).

The days when a popular Slate column provided a light-hearted, cleverly reported breather from the news of the day are long gone. Today, the explainer is increasingly the main course, and it makes a sad, sorry substitute for the original reporting and analysis once carried out in newsrooms staffed by actual experts — beat reporters — rather than dilettantes who find their information on Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia. 

Why make fun of these nice people? They just want to tell you how the world works.

Because explaining is not reporting, nor is it, as commonly practiced, journalism. It is more often a lukewarm rehash served to shallow thinkers for the purpose of furnishing them with memorable nuggets of conventional widsom suitable for repetition at cocktail parties. 

Also, nine times out of ten the people writing explainers have now idea whether what they're writing about is true, nor do they have any idea how the world works. They are the last people who should be writing explainers about anything, which is funny if you can manage to overlook the fact that it is actually the explainerizers who are making a mockery of journalism, and there's nothing funny about that at all.

Fair use. Parody and satire. 

I am an angry lawyer for whatever media organization is being mocked.

Not enough actual journalism happening there to keep you busy, eh? 

I found a funny example of Actually Journalism.
